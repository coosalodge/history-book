## Kaskanampo Lodge #310

Kaskanampo Lodge 310 was chartered by the Order of the Arrow, the B.S.A.’s National Brotherhood of Honor Campers, on July 11, 1945. It served the seven county Tennessee Valley Council out of Huntsville, Alabama. It was a Charter member of Area V-B that was affiliated with mostly Tennessee Lodges. The lodge was named after a tribe of Koasati Indians native to the area. Kaskanampo translated means “Men Warriors”. The lodge chose the Mussel Shell as their totem due to the abundance of the freshwater mussels in the Tennessee Valley and their importance to the Native Americans of the area.

The lodge was quartered at Camp Westmoreland outside of Florence, Alabama through 1979 and later at Camp Jackson near Scottsboro, Alabama. An OA Lodge was completed in 1967 at Camp Westmoreland when Kaskanampo was at her peak nationally. In 1965 the Lodge won several national awards at the Indiana University NOAC and Lodge Member Morgan W. Weed was honored with the Distinguished Service Award. In 1969, Mr. Bill Ingersoll, the Lodge Lay Adviser was honored with the DSA, giving Kaskanampo two honorees.

Eighteen Charter Members of the lodge were inducted at Camp Westmoreland on July 8, 1945. Ittawamba Lodge 235 from Jackson, Tennessee, inducted these new candidates. Mr. Charles “Chuck” Leonard Beard, Jr. was one of the Charter Members of Kaskanampo 310. He recalled the first Ordeal at Camp Westmoreland. “ I had been a Camper at Westmoreland for a few years from 1941 to 1943. In 1944 and 1945 I served on Jr. Staff at Camp and was honored to be selected for induction into the Order of the Arrow. I recall our Ordeal being conducted by a Lodge from Jackson, Tennessee. I really don’t recall much about the opening night Tap-Out but I do remember working on developing the trails for Camp as part of our Ordeal. It took all day long and we were pretty tired. On the second evening, we were taken to the second slough where there was a huge bonfire and torches lit up. It was a very memorable ceremony and we all received our Ordeal Sashes after a hard days work.”

The Charter Members of the lodge include: Mr. Henry Chase, Mr. Charles Coldiron, Mr. Clyde Hatalen, Mr. Robert McWright, Mr. Tom Reynolds – Scout Executive, Cole Alexander, Leonard Beard, Dick Brown, A. J. Coleman, Marshall Duke, Henry Foyer, Jimmy Hatley, Carlyle Hedden, Johnny Logan, James Lovelace, Karl Mittwede, Weldon Shannon, and Charles Thomas
