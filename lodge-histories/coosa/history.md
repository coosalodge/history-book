# Coosa Lodge History

## 2015

2015 was an exciting year for Coosa Lodge. As we concluded the Order of the Arrow’s national centennial celebration, we took stock of our achievements and began working on our vision for the next century of service.

In 2015, we inducted 273 new Ordeal members across three different Ordeals. Ordeal work projects provided more than 2,000 of hours of critical support to Camp Comer, Camp Sequoyah, and Camp Jackson. We saw 103 members attain Brotherhood. We recognized 13 of our Brothers with the Vigil Honor, in recognition of their distinguished contributions to Scouting and the Order of the Arrow.

At our 2015 Winter Banquet, we honored three Coosa Lodge members with the Founder’s Award as recognition of their unselfish service above and beyond their normal duties to their lodge: Nathan Moore, Mrs. Marty Jones, and Mr. Ed O’Neal.

We also recognized Thomas Willingham with a James E. West Fellowship for his outstanding, long-term dedication to service and excellence in Coosa Lodge.

As part of the Order of the Arrow’s centennial, a one-time award was created by the National Order of the Arrow Committee. The Centurion Award was created in order to commemorate those among us who are exemplars of the “high ideals and purpose of the Order of the Arrow.”

More than 1,800 members of the Order of the Arrow, past and present, were selected to receive this award. Coosa Lodge selected 12 of its own to recognize as Centurions.

In March, our 2015 Coosa Lodge Spring Pow-Wow was once again open to Cub Scouts and non-OA members. More than 400 Scouts and Scouters joined us at Camp Comer to learn about the Order of the Arrow, participate in a dozen different program areas, witness a world-class Webelos crossover ceremony, and enjoy a weekend of fun and fellowship.

In April, Coosa Lodge took a contingent of 160 members to Camp Sidney Dew in Rome, Georgia, for the 2015 SR-9 Section Conclave. More than 1,000 Arrowmen from Alabama and Georgia met that weekend for a weekend of fun, training, and fellowship. More than a dozen members of Coosa Lodge served in key leadership roles for the weekend.

In July, the Greater Alabama Council hosted a unique, traveling Order of the Arrow experience at Camp Comer. It was called “ArrowTour”, and it was an opportunity for members the Greater Alabama Council and many nearby councils to partake in a shared national Order of the Arrow centennial experience.

In August, 164 members of Coosa Lodge traveled to Michigan State University for the week-long National Order of the Arrow Conference. More than 15,000 Arrowmen were in attendance, making this the biggest conference in the history of the Order of the Arrow.

During the conference, Mr. Greg Moore was recognized with the Order of the Arrow’s Distinguished Service Award for his distinguished and outstanding service to the OA on a sectional level over many years.

Fewer than 1000 Distinguished Service Awards have been presented since its introduction in 1940.

Earlier this month, more than 320 members of Coosa Lodge came together, despite threats of cold and rain, to spend a weekend in fun and fellowship with their Brothers.

We said “Thank You” to our outgoing Lodge Chief and Lodge Adviser, who we can never thank enough for their service. We elected a new Lodge Chief and met our new Lodge Adviser, who each gave us a brief glimpse of what they hope to see Coosa Lodge achieve in 2016.
